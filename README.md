In this project, we applied our programming knowledge in the Python language to develop a simulation program of a conventional board game called "Battleship".

This is a guessing game with strategies, designed to be played between two users. The objective is to locate and sink the opponent's ships on a board. The user who finds and sinks all the ships first will be the winner.
